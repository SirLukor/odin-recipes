    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>
        A wonderful tasting choice to prepare your chicken. Making it this way makes it literally impossible
        for your chicken to come out dry.
    </p>

    <p>
        The perfect dish for Spring or Summer. Do you choose to make it suring Fall or Winter however, is that no problem.
        Subsitute the Lemon for an Orange or a Tangerine and the Thyme for a few sprigs of Rosemary and you'll be in heaven in no time again.
