    <h1>Hot and Sour Soup</h1>

    <img src="../images/Chinese-Hot-and-Sour-Soup-Recipe-1-2.jpg" alt="Hot and Steamy Soup">
    <h4>Description</h4>

    <p>And today’s recipe is one that I’ve been meaning to share with you on the blog for years, after literally dozens and dozens of you have requested it. (This usually comes up when I’m chatting about my favorite egg drop soup recipe — apparently many of you usually opt for the hot and sour soup at your favorite Chinese restaurants and have wanted to learn how to make it!)</p>
    <p>Well, good news, friends! Traditional hot and sour soup is actually incredibly easy to make as well. And the bonus of making it at home is that it’s also incredibly easy to customize to your taste. Like it extra hot? Add in more chili garlic sauce. Like it extra sour? Add in more rice wine vinegar. Like it vegetarian? Make it with tofu. Like the meat version? Just add in some pork.</p>
    <p>Trust me, this is one of those restaurant recipes that will taste just as good at home. And on chilly winter weeks like this one that we’re having here in Kansas City, it’s guaranteed to warm you up in the most delicious of ways.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
       <li>Broth: Either chicken or veggie stock (or broth) will do.</li> 
        <li>Mushrooms: I highly recommend using shiitake mushrooms, but baby bella or even button mushrooms would also do.</li>
        <li>Rice vinegar, soy sauce, chili garlic sauce, ground ginger: To flavor the broth</li>
        <li>Cornstarch: To thicken the broth</li>
        <li>Eggs: Which we will whisk, and the drizzle into the soup to make those lovely egg ribbons.</li>
        <li>Firm tofu: Which we will cube and add to the soup.</li>
        <li>Green onions: To stir into the soup and also sprinkle on top as a garnish.</li>
        <li>Toasted sesame oil: An essential flavor in the soup, which we will drizzle at the very end</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper: Hot and sour soup is traditionally made with white pepper, which (heads up) has a different and much stronger flavor than black pepper. I recommend adding in a pinch, and then you can always add in more later. Or if you don’t have white pepper, black pepper will also do.</li>
        <li>Optional: Many restaurant versions of hot and sour soup are also made with bamboo shoots. I’m personally not a fan of them, but you are welcome to add some in if you would like.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Recipe</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Optional: Many restaurant versions of hot and sour soup are also made with bamboo shoots. I’m personally not a fan of them, but you are welcome to add some in if you would like.</li>
        <li>Bring the soup to a simmer. Add the remaining stock, mushrooms, bamboo shoots (if using), rice wine vinegar, soy sauce, ginger and chili garlic sauce to a large stock pot, and cook until the soup reaches a simmer. Stir in the cornstarch slurry and continue cooking for a minute or so, until the soup has thickened.</li>
        <li>Drizzle in those beautiful egg ribbons! While stirring the soup in a circular motion with one hand, use your other hand to slowly drizzle the whisked eggs into the soup.</li>
        <li>Season the soup. Stir in the tofu, half of the green onions, and sesame oil. Then season the soup with salt and black pepper (or white pepper) to taste.</li>
        <li>Serve.  Ladle up your servings while the soup is nice and hot, garnished with extra green onions.</li>
    </ol>
